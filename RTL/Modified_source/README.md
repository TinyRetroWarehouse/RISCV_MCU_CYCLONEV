# Notice
I had to change a lot of code to make this compatible with old-fashined Quartus II systemverilog interpreter. Don't expect full compatibility when changing some prior defined parameters! I recomend using the system as is. Change the files at your own riskv! All files here are originated from the [Pulpino Project](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpino) (pulpino/ips/riscv).

# Important project defines files:

* config.sv;
* risc_config.sv
