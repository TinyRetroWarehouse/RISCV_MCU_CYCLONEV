# Elaborate project

To elaborate the project, first open the Quartus folder and open the RISCV_MCU.qpf. Then go to Tools -> Tcl scripts and run ../wrap_files.tcl. It will give an error, but the key source files will be added to the project. Check them at Assignment -> Settings -> Files.

Now, run "Analysis and Syntheis" at Processing -> Start -> Start Analysis and Syntheis or via the GUI menu.

To view the RTL schematic, go to Tools -> Netlist Viewers -> RTL Viewer
